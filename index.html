            <div>
                <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves
                    designing the visual elements, programming the functionality, and ensuring the site's performance
                    and security.</p>

                <h3>What is the key difference between 'flex' and 'auto' values for flex-basis property in flexbox?</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>'flex' value allows flex items to expand or shrink based on available space, while 'auto' value lets
                    items size themselves based on their content, ignoring any specified dimensions.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between auto and 1fr in grid?</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>"Auto" in grid layout allows a column or row to size itself <strong>based on its content</strong>,
                    while "1fr" assigns an equal portion of available space to the column or row <strong>inside the
                        grid.</strong></p>

                <h3>What is the difference between width and max-width?</h3>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>"Width" sets the initial width of an element, while "max-width" limits the maximum width an element
                    can attain, preventing it from exceeding the specified value.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>"Margin" creates space outside an element, affecting the spacing between elements, while "Padding"
                    creates space inside an element, affecting the element's content area.</p>

            <div>
                <p>"Transitions" define how property values change over a specified duration, while "Animations" allow
                    for more complex, multi-step effects with keyframes.</p>
